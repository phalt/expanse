# 🏗️ Install

## Early days

Before this becomes a fully fledged package, this project exists as a template you can fork and build from.

Once forked, all you have to do is run this command:

```bash
make build
```

Then finally, you can either run both the Flask and Typescript server in one terminal with:

```bash
make dev
```

Or run them independently with:

```bash
make serve
make web
```

This will start up the development server.

Now you can start the [tutorial](/tutorial/) to build your first RF page.
