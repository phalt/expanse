# ðŸ“‹ TODO

There is a bunch of stuff I want to add to RF, feel free to contribute!

* Add a `meta` class to the `PageProps` so things like the html `<title>` tag can be updated, etc.
* Put the JS into a CDN so there is less boilerplate.
* Abstract the types stuff so that it can be a generic library.
* Make the app more of a "package" so it is easier to install.
* Move all the `make` commands to a `RF` command line tool.
